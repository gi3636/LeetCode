# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return *the node at which the two lists intersect*. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

- `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
- `listA` - The first linked list.
- `listB` - The second linked list.
- `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
- `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_2.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_3.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```



### 题目解析

这一题是找出两个链表里的交集节点。我的想法是如果有交集节点，那么两个链表的最后节点肯定是一样的。所以我就先把两个链表遍历到最后然后做对比，如果一样表示有交集节点，如果不一样那就没有交集节点。接着每次从后往前对比，但这个方法因为链表没有记录之前的节点，所以超时了。过后我还是想不到其他方法，上网查了查，发现有个简单的做法，把两个链表的长度搞成一样，然后在一个个做比较。先查出两个链表的长度，然后把两个链表的长度相减，然后把长链表遍历n（两个链表长度相减的值）次。然后就可以一个个作对比了。



### 具体思路

1. 查出两个链表的长度
2. 把两个链表的长度做相减
3. 长的链表遍历 n 次 （n为相减的值）
4. 两个链表一个个节点作比较



### 代码实现

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {

        ListNode nodeA = headA;
        ListNode nodeB = headB;
        int countA = 0;
        int countB = 0;

        while (nodeA != null || nodeB != null) {
            if (nodeA != null) {
                nodeA = nodeA.next;
                countA++;
            }
            if (nodeB != null) {
                nodeB = nodeB.next;
                countB++;
            }
        }

        int temp = 0;
        if (countA > countB) {
            temp = countA - countB;
            for (int i = 0; i < temp; i++) {
                headA = headA.next;
            }
        } else {
            temp = countB - countA;
            for (int i = 0; i < temp; i++) {
                headB = headB.next;
            }
        }
        while (headA != null && headB != null) {
            if (headA == headB) {
                return headA;
            }

            headA = headA.next;
            headB = headB.next;
        }
        return null;

    }
}
