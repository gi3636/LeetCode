### 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II

Given a binary tree

```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/15/117_sample.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 6000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

 

**Follow-up:**

- You may only use constant extra space.
- The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

### Subject Analysis

This question is the same as the 116 question. The only difference is the system input was changed to normal binary tree. However the ideas is the same the 116 question and the code is not distinct from the 116 question.



### Code Implementation

```java
class Solution {
  public Node connect(Node root) {
        //非空判断
        if(root == null){
            return null;
        }
  
        //Level order traversal
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root);
        
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            Node pre = null;
            int count = queue.size();
            while(count>0){
                Node curr = queue.poll();
                if(curr.left != null){
                    queue.add(curr.left);
                }
                if(curr.right != null){
                    queue.add(curr.right);
                }
                
                //增加右节点
                if(count>0){
                    if(pre == null){
                        pre = curr;
                    }else{
                        pre.next = curr;
                        pre = curr;
                    }
                }
                count--;
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```
