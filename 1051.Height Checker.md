# 1051. Height Checker

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in **non-decreasing order** by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array `expected` where `expected[i]` is the expected height of the `ith` student in line.

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the **current order** that the students are standing in. Each `heights[i]` is the height of the `ith` student in line (**0-indexed**).

Return *the **number of indices** where* `heights[i] != expected[i]`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 5
Explanation:
heights:  [5,1,2,3,4]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices do not match.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
Explanation:
heights:  [1,2,3,4,5]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices match.
```

### 题目解析

这一题查出未按照递增排序的数量。克隆原数组，然后排序好。接下来就把排序好的数组和原数组作对比。有不一样的计数器就加一。



### 具体思路

1. 克隆原数组并排序。

2. 排序好的数组与原数组做对比。

3. 不一样计数器就加一。

   

### 代码实现

```java
class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        int temp = 0;
        int[] newArr = new int[heights.length];

        for (int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
            newArr[i] = heights[i];
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(newArr);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
            if (heights[i] != newArr[i]) {
                temp++;
            }
        }
        return temp;

    }
}
```
